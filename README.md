# ML Project on Creditworthiness

Predicting creditworthiness with classification models and impute missing data with regression models. The goal of this project was to predict creditworthiness with classification models and impute missing data with regression models. I did this project in a machine learning class, when I was a Computational Science student. If you have any questions about it, feel free to reach out to me.
